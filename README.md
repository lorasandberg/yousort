# YouSort - Sorting algorithm for subjective stuff

A silly tool that offers you a way to sort anything using any sorting criteria you want. What are the best and the worst songs in that one playlist? Which letter of the alphabet is most fun to write? Which fruit is the most inconvenient to peel and eat?

Steps to use:
1. Decide a set of items you want to be sorted.
2. Start sorting. The app gives you two items from the set, pick one of them using whatever criteria you wish to use.
3. Keep picking items until the set is sorted into a tidy little list.
